Hello.

Today is February 2nd, 2025 and I'm starting on a journey to share many of the things I've read, learned, explored, and found fun during my career as a software developer / engineer / programmer.

I make no claims on perfection or silver bullets. I realize the answer to a lot of questions is "it depends". But perhaps you can learn, I can learn, and that makes everyone better.

On with it!
